Four glasses are pladced on the corners of a square rotating table.
Some of the glasses are facing upwards and some upside-down.

Your goal is to arrange the glasses so that they are all facing up or all facing down. Here are the rules:

- You must keep your eyes closed at all times. (No tricks or lateral thinking, this is a pure logic puzzle)

- You can turn change the state of (flip) any number of glasses at any turn (turning all 4 is useless but 1
  2 or 3 can be done).

- After each turn, the table is rotated through a random angle (0, 90, 180, 270)

- At any point, if all four glasses are of the same orientation a bell will ring and you win.

Find a solution to ensure that all glasses have the same orientation (either up or down) in a finite number of turns. The algorithm must not depend on luck.
