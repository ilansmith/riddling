- make my site be able to show the pdf INLINE. One way to do it
	would be through scribd (do I want that ?!?).
- find a way to spell check the latex files and add it to the makefile.

- rethink the license for this package.

build system:
=============
- add an alternate path:
	tex -> dvi -> ps -> pdf
	latex	   dvips    ps2pdf 
- use everything to see drawings in the output (pdf as well as html).
