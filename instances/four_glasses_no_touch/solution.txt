First lets analyze what moves we can make.
Turning all four glasses is useless. If the state is X then we just get the opposite of it.
Turning 1 glass is ok.
Turning 2 glasses is ok too but we need to distinguish between turning 2 glasses which are next to each
other and turning two glasses which are opposite each other.
Turning 3 glasses is just like turning 1 glass as it takes up to opposites of turning 1 glass.
So here are the 3 moves we can make:
	- A: turn one glass
	- B: turn two glasses which are near
	- C: turn two opposite glasses.

Since there are 2^4 possible sitations and we don't distinguish between a state and it's
opposite we have 8 representative possible situations:
	0000/1111 (we don't care about this since this is win for us)
	p1:
		1000/0111
		0100/1011
		0010/1101
		0001/1110
	p2:
		1100/0011
		1001/0110
	p3:
		0101/1010

Note that:
	p3 -> A -> p1
	p3 -> B -> p2
	p3 -> C -> win

	p2 -> A -> p1
	p2 -> B -> p3
	p2 -> C -> p2

	p1 -> A -> p2 or p3
	p1 -> B -> p1
	p1 -> C -> p1

So the solution is:
	C B C A C B C

Since:
	p3 -> C -> win
	p2 -> C -> p2 -> B -> p3 -> C -> win
	p1 -> C -> p1 -> B -> p1 -> C -> p1
					-> A -> p3 -> C -> win
					-> A -> p2 -> C -> p2 -> B -> p3 -> C -> win

So in six moves we win the game no matter where we start.
