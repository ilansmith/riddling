Prove, in the simplest way, that the crescent of the moon
is not due to a shadow of earth on it (the earth being between
it and the sun).

Solution:
There are times when you see both the Sun and the crescent moon
in the sky (at evening time). You then know that the earth is
definately not between the sun and the moon and still the moon
is crescent.

Another solution is to point out that the crescent of the moon
does not look like a big planet since it is curved like the moon.
The earth is much bigger than the moon and so its crescent shadow
should be less curved.
