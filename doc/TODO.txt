Now:
====
- remove the ugly colors from the pdf output.
- make google links work right (try scribd ?!?).

latex code:
===========
- find a way to spell check the latex files and add it to the makefile.
- give better colors to the hyper links in the latex.
- mark all TODO items the same way (using a latex macro?!?).

sketch code:
============
- start breaking down the .sk files into chunks of defs and reusing them all
over to avoid code duplication.

licensing:
==========
- rethink the license for this package.

build system:
=============
- make the makefile check that all the tools that it is going to use are ready for use.
	Do that using an external perl script.
	This way people won't get funky error messages well off into the build process.
- write a perl wrapper for lacheck (it is also problematic).
- build each .sk into an image of it's own. This way it will be very easy to work on the drawings
	and I could make a logo for the riddling project itself.

direct pdf viewing on web:
==========================
- when using the google API to see the pdf directly in an iframe in my web page links like the table
of content (intra-document PDF links) do not work. Links to the outside do work. Check if we can fix this.

misc:
=====
- collect links to various riddling sites over the web in the 'doc' folder.
- remove lots of the manuals that I carry in doc and have command to show them from ubuntu (provided
	that they do exist in some ubuntu -doc package that is...).
