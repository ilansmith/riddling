100 hats with with numbers 1-100 randomly shuffled and placed under them are placed in a hall.
100 midgets with numbers 1-100 will enter the hall. Each will be able to pick up 50 of the hats
in order to find his number. No communication during the experiment is possible.
How will you maximize the chance that ALL midgets will find their names?

Looking simply on the problem it looks like the chances of each midget to find his name is 0.5
and therefore the overall chance of ALL of them finding their names is 0.5^100 which is a very
low probability.
