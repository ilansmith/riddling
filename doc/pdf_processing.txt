Issues having to do with the quality of the pdf produced...
===========================================================
- The version coming out of our pdf production pipeline is 1.4.
	(you can use 'pdfinfo(1)' on the output to see this).

- There are also no author markings on the pdf itself.
	(you can use 'pdfinfo(1)' on the output to see this).

- The output is not serialized for the web (optimized).
	(you can use 'pdfinfo(1)' on the output to see this).

- You can use the 'qpdf' tool to fix some of that (optimized for instance
	and set the versino to 1.5).
	use:
	qpdf --linearize --force-version=1.5 [in.pdf] [out.pdf]
