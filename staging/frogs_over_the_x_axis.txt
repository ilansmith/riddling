Imagine you have frogs that can jump over other frogs.
They can only leap a distace of 2 in any of 4 directions (north, south, west and east).
They can only leap when there is a frog between them and the landing place.

You have as many of these located in the "southern part" of the XY plane
    { (p,q) E N^2 | q <= 0 }

How far into the northen part of the plane can you bring the frogs?

To be specific, prove that you *cannot* bring a frog to a co-ordinate where
it's y position will be more or equal to 5.
