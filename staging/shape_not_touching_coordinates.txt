A shape of size < 1 is drawn on the plane.
Show that the shape can be moved in a way such that no point p=(x,y)
that belong to share satisfies x E Z and y E Z. This means that the shape
does not contain any points whose co-ordinates are whole.

Solution
Put the shape anywhere on the plane.
Cut the shape into 1x1 squares at whole co-ordinates.
Put all these "slides" on top of each other.
These must be a point (and it's immediate surrounding) which is not in any
of the slides. If these is none then it means that the area of the share
is >= 1.
If that point is (0,0) on the overdubbed slides then we are done because
	it means that the shape does not touch any whole co-ordinate.
If that point is (x,y) then move the shape -x along the x axis and -y along
	the y axis which will move all the shapes simulteneously and will make
	that point become (0,0) and we are done.
