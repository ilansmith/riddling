- create a pdflatex invocation wrapper that will create all outputs 444 and will remove the
	ugly output from the screen.

- move into github.

- find a way to spell check the latex files and add it to the makefile.

- when compiling via tex we give a directory where the output should reside as
	--directory-or-some-such $(dir $@)
	This means that tex gets:
	--directory tex/
	The extra slash at the end causes the entire compilation process to be
	conducted with two slashses.
	Remove it.
