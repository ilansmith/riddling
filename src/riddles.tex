\section{Rational points on a circle}

\subsection{Question}

Could there be a circle on the plane where only one point has rational co-ordinates? A point has rational co-ordinates if $x,y\in\mathbb{Q}$. What about a sphere? Are there circles with more than one rational point? Are there circles with infinite rational points? Can you find a circle with exactly $n$ rational points on it for each $n\in\mathbb{N}$?

\subsection{Solution}

Yes, there could. Consider the circle: $(x-r)^2+y^2=r^2$ for some irrational $r$.
$(0,0)$ is a point on this circle and is rational. But from the equation it follows
that: $x^2-2xr+r^2+y^2=r^2$ or $x^2+y^2=2xr$ or $r=(x^2+y^2)/2x$. If there
was a rational solution to this equation where $x\ne0$ then it would follow that
$r$ is rational since it is the result of multiplication, division, addition and subtration
of rational number and this is a contradiction. This means that this equation can only
have rational solutions for $x=0$. $(0,0)$ is the only such solution.

Same solution applies to a sphere: $(x-r)^2+y^2+z^2=r^2$ for some irrational $r$.
In this case: $r=(x^2+y^2+z^2)/2x$. Which means that for $x\ne0$ any rational soultion would imply a rational $r$.
$(0,0,0)$ is therefor the only rational solution.

Yes, there are circles with more than one rational point. Take $x^2+y^2=2$ which is the circle whose
center is at $(0,0)$ and whose radius is $\sqrt{2}$. The points $(1,1),(-1,1),(1,-1),(-1,-1)$ are four rational
points which are on this circle.

Yes, there are circles with infinite rational points.
