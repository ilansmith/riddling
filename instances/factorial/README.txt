How many zeroes you have at the right side of the number which is equal to 100! (100 factorial)?

Solution
========
100 adds 2 zeroes
10, 20, .. , 90 add 9 zeroes
5, 15, 25, .. , 95 add another 10 (for every 5 there is even number to turn it into a 10).
25, 50, 75 add 3 more (since they have another 5 factor in them)

total= 2 + 9 + 10 + 3 = 24
