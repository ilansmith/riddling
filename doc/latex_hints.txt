- the executable we run
we need to run pdflatex and and pdftex since pdflatex has access to all the libraries of tex
while pdftex does not.

- if you want to see if the thumbnail generation thing worked you can use acroread by adobe.
	a package by the name of 'acroread' is available for ubuntu.

Bookmarks in the pdf files
==========================
If you want the bookmarks you need to run pdflatex TWO TIMES on the input.
If you only run one time you get no bookmarks (it's a second pass thing...).
Stangely, this also reduces the size of the output file so it's good either way.
