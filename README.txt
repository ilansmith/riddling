This is the riddling project

The idea is to create a collection of many riddles for your enjoyment.

Tools include: make, pdflatex, lacheck, latex, dvips, ps2pdf, latex2html, perl, sketch, git,
	flexpaper, pdf2swf, qpdf, pdfinfo, pdftex, pdftohtml, luatex, xetex and possibly more.

If you want to see the result checkout:

If you want to compile this package then:
- install all required packages.
	Ubuntu users you are in luck: just run 'scripts/ubuntu_install.sh'...
- make
All the output is in the 'out' folder.
