Now:
====
- finish the bottles riddle with correct sketches.
- fix the issue with html and images and publish html on my site (instead of inlined pdf
that I have now ?!?).

better quality of latex:
========================
- find a way to spell check the latex files and add it to the makefile.

licensing:
==========
- rethink the license for this package.

build system:
=============
- write a perl wrapper for lacheck (it is also problematic).
- build each .sk into an image of it's own. This way it will be very easy to work on the drawings
	and I could make a logo for the riddling project itself.
