Now:
====
- fix the issue with html and images and publish.
- finish the bottles riddle with correct sketches.

website:
========
- make my site be able to show the pdf INLINE. One way to do it
	would be through scribd (do I want that ?!?).

better quality of latex:
========================
- find a way to spell check the latex files and add it to the makefile.

licensing:
==========
- rethink the license for this package.

build system:
=============
- write a wrapper for lacheck (it is also problematic).
