A tower has 100 floors. You have two eggs. You objective is to
find the maximal floor from which you can drop an egg without
breaking it. All eggs are the same. You cannot use an egg once
it is broken. What is the minimal number of drops of eggs you
can find this maximum and how would you conduct this experiment?

Solution:
We would split the tower into sections. We will climb from section
to section. Once the first egg breaks we know that the sought
after floor is in the previous section. We will continue to find
the floor by climbing one floor at a time in that section.

In order to minimize number of attempt we will make each higher
section be shorter by 1 in length than the preceding section.

Lets calculate the length of the sections.
First lets note that the last section should be as short as possible.
There is no advantage to a last section which is more than 1. Why?
Well the size of the first section is the number of attempts. The smaller
that size, the better. If the last section is not one we may reach a smaller
first section by reducing all sections.

OK. The we want:

	n*(n+1)/2 = 100
	n=13.651

We round up and get n=14 (since 13*14/2=91 and we have not covered the entire
building but 14*15/2=105. A little waste but what can you do?

So the places to drop the first egg from will be:
	14, 14+13, 14+13+12, ...

But what if we have 3 eggs?
We then will solve with recursion.
