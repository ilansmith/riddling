A village eldar says to the village's residents: we want more women in the village.
So please stop giving birth to babies only after you have a daughter.
This plan is meant to offset the balance of women to men in the village in favour
of women.
Does it work?

Solution:
No, it does not work. Ratio of boys to girls will be 1:1.

One way to explain it is this:
let the villagers birth as many babies as they want
until everyone has a daughter. The distribution of boys to girls is 1:1 (obvious).
Now we will kill (exile?) all children that have a baby sister. These exiled children
are also distributed 1:1. We are left with a 1:1 distribution of boys to girls and this
is identical to the experiment advocated by the village elder.

Another way is just saying: it does not matter that you stop when you have a daughter since
the distribution up to that point was 1:1 and will remain so with the daughter included.

Another way to show this is to make the calculation:
50% of the village are going to have a daughter on the first birth.
25% of the village are going to have a daughter on the second birth.
	contributing 25% of boys too.
12.5% of the village are going to have a daughter on the third birth.
	contributing 12.5%*2 boys too.
6.25% of the village are going to have a daughter on the fourth birth.
	contributing 6.25%*3 boys too.
....

Lets denote:
s = 1/4*1 + 1/8*2 + 1/16*3 + 1/32*4 + ... 

s = 1/4*1 + 1/8*2 + 1/16*3 + 1/32*4 + ... = 1/4+1/8+1/16+1/32+... + 1/8 + 1/16*2 + 1/32*3 =
1/2 + (1/8 + 1/16*2 + 1/32*3 + ...) = 1/2 + s/2

so:
s/2=1/2

and:
s=1

That means that the number of boys is equal to the number of couples birthing. The number of girls
is also equal to the number of couples birthing. This means that the ration is 1:1.

In fact any condition by which to stop birthing will fail in producing a ration of boys to girls
which is different than 1:1 since each birth is independent of others (unless the condition itself
is about that very same ration - say "stop when ration of girls to boys is 6:1". But this type of
condition may never materialize).

* Interesting follow up riddle. If the eldar was to say ""stop when ration of girls to boys is 6:1"
what are the chances that the experiment will end?
