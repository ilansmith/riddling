Converting latex to html
========================
- Is done using the latex2html tool.
- I still need to check if the result is good enough.
- Some makefile trickery was needed.

converting latex to pdf
=======================
1) pdflatex - seems to work but has problems with the sketch images.
2) latex -> dvi -> ps -> pdf
	using latex(1), dvips(1), ps2pdf(1)
	This seems to produce shorter output than 'pdflatex' and also handles images properly.

* The second is the selected way for now.

Makefile descisions:
====================
- output should be kept separate from the input since in this project there are a lot of junk files which are generated by the tools (latex generates many files, doing thumbs for pdf generates many files and the conversion to html generates tons).
