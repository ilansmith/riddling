A tower has 100 floors. You have two eggs. You objective is to
find the maximal floor from which you can drop an egg without
breaking it. All eggs are the same. You cannot use an egg once
it is broken. What is the minimal number of drops of eggs you
can find this maximum and how would you conduct this experiment?

Solution:
We would split the tower into sections. We will climb from section
to section. Once the first egg breaks we know that the sought
after floor is in the previous section. We will continue to find
the floor by climbing one floor at a time in that section.

In order to minimize number of attempt we will make each higher
section be shorter by 1 in length than the preceding section.

Lets calculate the length of the sections.
