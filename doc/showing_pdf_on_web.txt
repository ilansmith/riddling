The best discussion of this is at:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/291813/best-way-to-embed-pdf-in-html

I found flexpaper http://flexpaper.devaldi.com/download/ to help me with this.
	This didn't work out because in some browsers it had problems with adobe flash security.

Embedding direct <object> tags didn't work in a lot of the browsers too.

The solution I settled for is to use google docs. See the example that I have under public_html and
in the wordpress system.

A solution I have yet to try is scribd.
