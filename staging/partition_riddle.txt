A n*(n+1)/2 collection of identical coins is partitioned in some way.
Now an iterative process starts: at each state one coin is taken from
each group and these are used to form a new group. Every group that
has no more coins disappears. Prove that this process will converge
to a situation where the group sizes are 1,2,3,...,n
