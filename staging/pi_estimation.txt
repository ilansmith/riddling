Write a program to give you better and better estimations of PI (3.1415...).
Do this without resorting to Taylor type series approximation.

Your solution should be one which is easy to code and is deterministic in the following
way: the longer you run it the better approximation of PI you will get.

Solution:
one way of doing it is sampling floating point random number pairs (x,y) where
x, y in (-0.5, 0.5) and counting those that fall in the unit circle (sqrt(x^2+y^2)<=0.5)).
The area of the unit circle is pi*r^2= pi*0.5*0.5=pi/4
The area of the square cirlce is 1.
The ration between them is pi/4 so just multiply the ratio of good pair/bad pairs by 4.

The problem with this solution is that it's statistical in nature and depends on a good
random number generator. You are NOT guaranteed that higher number of samplings will give
you better and better estimations of PI.
