Rorig=40000/2*PI

Rnew=(40000+0.01)/2*PI=Rorig+10m/2*PI=Rorig+10/6.28=Rorig+1.6m

This result is quite surprising. Intuition says that 10m is nothing and should
be very close to the surface. It turns out that the addition in height is
independant of the circumfence of the thing you are adding to! 10m will buy you
1.6 meters on the sun as well...:)
