- move into github.
- add riddling in my blog with:
	- access to this pdf.
	- link to the repository on github.
- create a pdflatex invocation wrapper that will create all outputs 444 and will remove the
	ugly output from the screen.
- find a way to spell check the latex files and add it to the makefile.
- when compiling via tex we give a directory where the output should reside as
	--directory-or-some-such $(dir $@)
	This means that tex gets:
	--directory tex/
	The extra slash at the end causes the entire compilation process to be
	conducted with two slashses.
	Remove it.
- move all latex documentation into their own folders.
- create a text file with links to latex documentation sites.
- find how to run latex:
	- without it interactivly stopping in the middle when there are errors.
	- with maximum warnings and errors.
- can I translate latex into html?
