Four glasses are pladced on the corners of a square rotating table.
Some of the glasses are facing upwards and some upside-down.

Your goal is to arrange the glasses so that they are all facing up or all facing down. Here are the rules:

- You must keep your eyes closed at all times. (No tricks or lateral thinking, this is a pure logic puzzle)

- You can turn change the state of (flip) any number of glasses at any turn (turning all 4 is useless but 1
  2 or 3 can be done).

- After each turn, the table is rotated through a random angle (0, 90, 180, 270)

- At any point, if all four glasses are of the same orientation a bell will ring and you win.

Find a solution to ensure that all glasses have the same orientation (either up or down) in a finite number of turns. The algorithm must not depend on luck.

What about 5 glasses? 8?

Follow up 2
You are allowed to touch any two glasses of your choice at everyround before you decide
which glasses to flip. What is your strategy now and how shorter is it?

What if you want all glasses to be up? or down? (not either all up or all down). What is your strategy now?
