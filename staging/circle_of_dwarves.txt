N dwarves will participate in the following experiment: they will be placed in a circle.
Then a hat of color black or white will be placed on the head of each. No dwarf will know
what hat is on his head but they will all see the hats on other dwarves heads. No exchange
of information is possible. At a point in time they will be required to all shout the hat
color on their own head. They need to plan a strategy before-hand that will maximize
the chance that they will *all* be right.

Solution:
They decide, arbitrarily, that they number of black hats will be odd. The chance for this
is 50%. Then each dwarf will calculte his/her own hat color according to that premise.
That means that they will have a 50% chance of all being right.
This kind of defies common sense but the key to understanding why this works is understanding
that we are synchronizing all of their responses (for instance, all dwarves seeing odd
number of black hats will ALL be silent).

TODO:
- write a python simulation of this.
