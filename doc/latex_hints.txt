running pdflatex
================

- the executable we run
we need to run pdflatex and and pdftex since pdflatex has access to all the libraries of tex
while pdftex does not.

- if you want to see if the thumbnail generation thing worked you can use acroread by adobe.
	a package by the name of 'acroread' is available for ubuntu.

bookmarks in the pdf files
==========================
If you want the bookmarks you need to run pdflatex TWO TIMES on the input.
If you only run one time you get no bookmarks (it's a second pass thing...).
Stangely, this also reduces the size of the output file so it's good either way.

comments in latex files
=======================
Just add % at the start of the line and the rest is a comment.

hyperlinkx in latex files
=========================
I tried to put them this way:
\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_number}{Catalan numbers}
But it turned out that this works well in PDF but doesn't show nice in HTML.

Then I tried this way:
\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_number}
It works in both PDF and HTML but does not allow set custom text for the link and shows
the entire link (ugly!).

Then I tried this way:
\htmladdnormallink{Catalan numbers}{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_number}
And it works well in both!!!

Lets try it another way.
