converting latex to html
========================
- Is done using the latex2html tool.
- I still need to check if the result is good enough.
- Some makefile trickery was needed.

converting latex to pdf
=======================
1) pdflatex - seems to work but has problems with the sketch images.
2) latex -> dvi -> ps -> pdf
	using latex(1), dvips(1), ps2pdf(1)
	This seems to produce shorter output than 'pdflatex' and also handles images properly.

Comparison of them:
- both seem to show table of content (if you run them twice).

* The second is the selected way for now (because it handles images and has smaller output).

Makefile descisions:
====================
- output should be kept separate from the input since in this project there are a lot of junk files which are generated by the tools (latex generates many files, doing thumbs for pdf generates many files and the conversion to html generates tons). So an output folder is required where all
output would reside.
