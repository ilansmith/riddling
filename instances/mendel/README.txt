This is my attempt to fully understand mendelism.

I assume a population of size N with two genes for each participant.
	At first all genes have A variation (two A's for each participant).
	One of the participants has one B gene (which is dominant).
	Whenever two copulate a coin is flipped and according to the coin
	toss the left or the right gene is taken from number 1 and the reverse
	from number 2.

	The idea is to see what happens to the trait after some time.

	Table of genotype to phenotype is:
	A	A	A
	A	B	B
	B	A	B
	B	B	B
