Now:
====
- fix the issue with html and images and publish html on my site (instead of inlined pdf
that I have now ?!?).
- finish the bottles riddle with correct sketches.

better quality of latex:
========================
- find a way to spell check the latex files and add it to the makefile.

licensing:
==========
- rethink the license for this package.

build system:
=============
- write a perl wrapper for lacheck (it is also problematic).
