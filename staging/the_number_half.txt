A teacher writes a list of 96 fractions on a board:
1/96 , 2/96 , 3/96 ... , 95/96 , 96/96

He then asks a student to play a game: for every turn, he picks any two numbers a and b on the board, remove them, and add 2ab - a - b + 1 to the list.

The question is: what will the last number be after 95 turns?"

Solution: 0.5

Why:

If f(a,b) = 2ab - a - b + 1
then f(0.5, b) = 2*0.5*b - 0.5 - b + 1 = b + 0.5 - b = 0.5
and in the same way f(a, 0.5) = 0.5

So, because 0.5 is part of the sequence of numbers (48/96) then once it is written it will never be changed.
That is also why the author of the riddle picked an even number (96) and not an odd one.
