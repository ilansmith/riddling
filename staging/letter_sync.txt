This one is from the internet

You get a letter that states:
This letter was send to exactly 100 people and you are one of the lucky 100. On it you will find a return address.
You may choose to reply to the return address or you may choose not to reply.
If I get just one reply then each of the 100 people will get a million dollars.
If I get no reply or more than one reply none of you will get anything.

How could you maximize your chances of winning?

* The other participants are very smart (at least as smart as yourself...)

Solution
========
The idea is to roll a die to decide if to send or not send the letter.
The other participants will do the same calculation. So we'll assume
that we all calculated the same p.

The chance of winning is made up of disjoint events which can be summed up:
	only participant 1 sends + only participant 2 sends + ... + only participant 100 sends =

	p*pow(1-p,99) + (1-p)*p*pow(1-p,98) + ... + pow(1-p,99)*p =
	100*p*pow(1-p,99)

Intuition says that maximum should be gotten when p=0.01 but lets calculate:

	f(p) = 100*p*pow(1-p,99)
	f'(p) = 100*1*pow(1-p,99)+100*p*99*pow(1-p,98)*-1 =
		100*pow(1-p,99)-100*99*p*pow(1-p,98)

	maximum is at f'(p)=0 so:
		100*pow(1-p,99) = 100*99*p*pow(1-p,98)
		1-p = 99*p
		100*p=1
		p=0.01

Wow - the intuition was spot on.

It turns out that for a 100 people this number is about 3.7 (which is pretty high).
For a million it drops only to 0.367. Surprising.
