On a standard 8 by 8 chess board are 64 coins where each coin is lying either in
heads or tails position.

Player A is let into the room where the chess board is. A host arrives and points
at a specific position (n,m) on the chess board. Player A is allowed to flip
at most one coin on the board. This coin can be any coin he chooses.
Then player A is whisked away to a vacation in the maldive islands.

Player B enters the room and must point to the square (n,m) that was selected by the host.

Find a strategy that could be decided upon by players A and B together before
the experiment to make it successful.
