nice strange one I just solved after I spent a day trying to prove it couldn't be done.

There's an infinite (countable) number of dwarfs standing in a row, each wears a Black or White hat (chosen randomly by a coin toss which is equivalent to choosing a number from 0 to 1 included and distributing the hats according to the binary representation of the number).

Then each dwarf starting from the first has to guess the hat on his head, if right he is left alive otherwise he is killed, is there a strategy where only a finite number of dwarfs makes the wrong guess. 

Can you do it if the dwarfs don't here each other (in other words if they all guess simultaneously).

Everyone sees whoever is in front of them, they are standing in one long line.
